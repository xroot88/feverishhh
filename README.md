## Hi feverishhh,

I provided this file to communicate : )

You can tell me when you have free time to talk and post a google meet link here.

Thank you.


# Hi feverishhh,

If you keep mentioning gmeet and similar in the fiverr's chat - they will ban both of us.

Instead, clone the repo, add text to this file, and create a PR to this repo.

I know we have nothing to hide; however, fiverr does not think so.


# Hi feverishhh,

My apologies, I didn't realize my github does not notify me of PRs.

I can meet at 8:30am CST on Wednesday. Does that work for you?
